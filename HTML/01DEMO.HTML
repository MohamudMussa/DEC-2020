        Somalia[a], officially the Federal Republic of Somalia is a sovereign country in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti[12] to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland.[13] Its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains, and highlands.[5] Hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.[14]

        Somalia has an estimated population of around 15 million[15][16] and has been described as Africa's most culturally homogeneous country.[17][18] Around 85% of its residents are ethnic Somalis,[5] who have historically inhabited the country's north. Ethnic minorities are largely concentrated in the south.[19] The official languages of Somalia are Somali and Arabic.[5] Most people in the country are Muslims,[20] the majority of them Sunni.[21]
        
        In antiquity, Somalia was an important commercial center.[22][23] It is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt.[24][25][26] During the Middle Ages, several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade, including the Ajuran Sultanate, the Adal Sultanate, and the Sultanate of the Geledi.
